- Revenue: 0€ (+ Taxes Return: 650 = 650)
  - I expected a revenue of 0€ because the Prologue is donation/shareware
    - The only external revenue were Taxes returns from previous year (2020)  
      and for now, I am unemployed and I don't have any other Economic activities related to revenue.
        - Taxes Returns: 650€
